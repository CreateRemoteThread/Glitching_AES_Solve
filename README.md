# Glitching_AES_Solve
Files for solving Glitching_AES for Donjon CTF, including raw powre traces in glitch/

These are raw solution files, and are provided for reference only - they have not been cleaned up for automation. No further work is intended on these files, as the approach is "enlightening, but dumb".

Thankyou to the Ledger Donjon team for creating an excellent CTF, and keeping the infrastructure well-maintained throughout. See you in 2021!
